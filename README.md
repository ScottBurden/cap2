# Wedding Album

Users can register to upload photos of their choosing, then see them arranged in different ways by clicking links to each route in the navbar. The arrangements are adapted from MaterialUI, selected photos are stored in state with React Context hooks, and the app utilizes requests to AWS S3 for data. 

### Built with React, React-DOM, Node and PostgresQL with several APIs:

- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
